Stack can be implimented by ARRAY,OBJECT,LINKEDList

Mostly ARRAY has been Used
Why ?
cz of complexity
1)Array 
    for Enqueue (add to back) we use push, who's timeComplexity is                                           O(1) and 
    for Dequeue (remove from back) we use pop, who's timeComplexity is                                       O(1) and 
    Space Complexity                                                                                         O(n)

2)Linked List
    for Enqueue (add to back) we use node with some pointer to point next node address                       O(1) and 
    for Dequeue (remove from back) we use node with some pointer to point next node address                  O(1)  and 
    Space Complexity                                                                                         O(n) (more memory due to pointers)

3)object
    for Enqueue (add to back) we create array like obj logic , who's timeComplexity is                       O(1) and 
    for Dequeue (remove from back) we create array like obj logic , who's timeComplexity is                  O(1)  and 
    Space Complexity                                                                                         O(n) (extra memory for keys)

There For,
    Array can be best in this sittuvation 
    cz no need to write our  logic code cz its alredy created
